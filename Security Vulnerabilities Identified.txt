#Security Vulnerabilities Identified#

Hard Coded Secret Key
The session secret key is hardcoded, and it should be stored securely.

Session Fixation
The session is not regenerated upon login. This permits an attacker to perform session fixation.

Password Storage and Hashing
While bcrypt is used here, ensure there is a secure hashing algorithm with sufficient rounds to be considered secure for password protection.

Error Disclosure
Specific error messages ("Invalid credentials!") leak information that may potentially help an attacker in brute force or credential-stuffing attacks.

Lack of Rate Limiting
No rate limiting is enforced, enabling brute-force attacks against the login endpoint.


#Tools for Security Analysis#

Static Code Analyzers: Use tools like ESLint with security plugins to analyze your code for potential vulnerabilities.

Dynamic Analysis Tools: Use tools like OWASP ZAP to perform dynamic analysis on your application while it's running.

Dependency Scanners: Use tools like Snyk or npm audit to identify vulnerabilities in your project dependencies.
